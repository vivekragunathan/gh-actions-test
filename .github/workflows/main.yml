# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the main branch
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      name:
        description: 'Person to greet' # Friendly description to be shown in the UI instead of 'name'
        default: 'World'               # Default value if no value is explicitly provided
        required: true                 # Input has to be provided for the workflow to run

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
      - name: Run a one-line script
        run: |
          echo .... $(date +'%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S') ..............
          echo Hello ${{ github.event }}
          echo Hello ${{ github.event.inputs }}
          echo Hello ${{ github.event.inputs.name }}

      # Runs a set of commands using the runners shell
      - name: Run a multi-line script
        run: |
          echo Add other actions to build,
          echo test, and deploy your project.
